Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_MeasureChan -This method performs measurement on one channel. (Note: If the <number of conversions> is more than one 
                the conversion of the A/D channel is performed specified number of times.)

Module "PPG1"      (component PPG)
   - PPG1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the signal generation. Events may be generated 
                (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>).

                disabled, it is possible to call <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods.
   - PPG1_SetPeriodUS -This method sets the new period of the output signal. The period is expressed in [microseconds] as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is 
                selected in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.

                16-bit unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is 
                selected in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.
   - PPG1_SetPeriodSec -This method sets the new period of the output signal. The period is expressed in [seconds] as a 16-bit 
                unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is selected 
                in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.
   - PPG1_SetPeriodReal -This method sets the new period of the output signal. The period is expressed in [seconds] as a real 
                number. To use this method the compiler have to support floating point operations. This method is available 
                only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is selected in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting 
                area.
   - PPG1_SetFreqHz -This method sets the new frequency of the output signal. The frequency is expressed in [Hz] as a 16-bit 
                unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is selected 
                in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.
   - PPG1_SetFreqkHz -This method sets the new frequency of the output signal. The frequency is expressed in [kHz] as a 16-bit 
                unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is selected 
                in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.
   - PPG1_SetFreqMHz -This method sets the new frequency of the output signal. The frequency is expressed in [MHz] as a 16-bit 
                unsigned integer number. This method is available only if the runtime setting type 'from interval' is selected 
                in the <Timing dialog box> of the Runtime setting area.
   - PPG1_SetRatio16 -This method sets a new duty-cycle ratio. Ratio is expressed as a 16-bit unsigned integer number. Value 0 
                - 65535 value is proportional to ratio 0 - 100%.   Note: Calculated duty depends on the timer possibilities and 
                on the selected period.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not selected.
   - PPG1_SetDutyUS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in microseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not selected.
   - PPG1_SetDutyMS -This method sets the new duty value of the output signal. The duty is expressed in milliseconds as a 
                16-bit unsigned integer number.  The method is available only if method <SetPeriodMode> is not selected.
   - PPG1_ClrValue -This method clears (sets to "0" = "Low") timer flip-flop output signal level. It allows to the user to 
                directly set the output pin value (=flip-flop state), and can set the signal polarity. This method only works 
                when the timer is disabled (Disable) otherwise it returns the error code. <ClrValue> and <SetValue> methods are 
                used for setting the initial state.

                property for limitations).
   - Bits_RGB_PutVal -Specified value is passed to the Input/Output component. If the direction is [input] saves the value to a

                [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] it writes the value to 
                the pins. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).

                written value (see <Safe mode> property for limitations).
   - Bits_RGB_PutBit -Specified value is passed to the specified bit/pin of the Input/Output component. If the direction is 
                [input] it saves the value to a memory or register, this value will be written to the pin after switching to 
                the output mode - using [SetDir(TRUE)] (see <Safe mode> property for limitations). If the direction is [output] 
                it writes the value to the pin. (Method is available only if the Direction = _[output]_ or _[input/output]_).
